This quick-start guide uses the Sunstone Web UI to demonstrate a short first-use workflow for deploying a simple K8s Cluster with OneKS. CLI and API workflows are covered in [K8s Cluster Lifecycle Management]({{% relref "k8s_cluster_lifecycle_management" %}}). Before beginning this quick-start guide, ensure to complete the steps in the [Basic Configuration Guide]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/basic_configuration/" %}}).

Quick-start workflow:

* **Prepare the Environment**: [Verify the minimum OneKS, OneGate, networking, profile, and permission requirements]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/basic_configuration/" %}}).  
* **Create the K8s Cluster**: Use the Sunstone Web UI K8s Cluster creation wizard.  
* **Wait for the K8s Cluster**: Wait until the K8s Cluster reaches the `RUNNING` state.  
* **Retrieve kubeconfig**: Copy the kubeconfig from the K8s Cluster detail view.  
* **Validate Kubernetes Access**: Run `kubectl get nodes` using the retrieved kubeconfig.  
* **Add Worker Capacity**: Create a node group if worker nodes are required.  
* **Validate Workload Deployment**: Deploy a simple NGINX workload and test in-cluster service connectivity.

## Create a New K8s Cluster

From the left-hand navigation menu in Sunstone, go to **Kubernetes -> K8S Clusters**:

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/create_k8s_cluster_1.png"
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/create_k8s_cluster_1.png"
alt="OneKS create Cluster step 1" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Click **Create** to start the K8s Cluster creation wizard.

The wizard guides you through the required configuration steps:

* **General**: K8s Cluster name and optional description.  
* **Select a Public Virtual Network**: Public network used for external connectivity and bootstrap paths.  
* **Select a Private Virtual Network**: Private network used for internal K8s Cluster communication.  
* **Kubernetes Version**: Kubernetes version to deploy.  
* **Flavours**: Control-plane flavour to use.  
* **User inputs**: Remaining values required by the selected profile and flavour.

In the **General** step, provide the basic K8s Cluster information. Enter a K8s Cluster name and, optionally, a description.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/create_k8s_cluster_2.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/create_k8s_cluster_2.png"
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster general" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

In **Select a Public Virtual Network**, select the public Virtual Network that will provide external connectivity for the K8s Cluster. The public network acts as the gateway to the Internet and is used by the K8s Cluster to expose external access where required.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/create_k8s_cluster_3.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/create_k8s_cluster_3.png"
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster public network" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

In **Select a Private Virtual Network**, select the private Virtual Network that will be used for internal K8s Cluster communication. This network provides isolation from the public Internet and is used for communication between the K8s Cluster nodes.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/create_k8s_cluster_4.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/create_k8s_cluster_4.png"
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster private network" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

In **Kubernetes Version**, select the Kubernetes version you intend to deploy. Only the versions available in the environment are shown.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/create_k8s_cluster_version.png"
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/create_k8s_cluster_version.png"
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

In **Flavours**, select the control-plane flavour for the K8s Cluster. The flavour defines the control-plane deployment model and the resources used by the control-plane nodes.

Available options include:

* **Single-node Control Plane**: Deploys one control-plane node. Suitable for development, evaluation, and non-critical workloads.  
* **Highly Available Control Plane**: Deploys three control-plane nodes with built-in redundancy. Suitable for production or environments that require higher availability.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/create_k8s_cluster_flavours.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/create_k8s_cluster_flavours.png"
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

In **User Inputs**, review the remaining user input parameters required by the selected K8s Cluster configuration.

After completing the required fields, finish the wizard to start K8s Cluster creation. You will be redirected to the **Kubernetes Logs** view, where you can monitor the provisioning process.

During provisioning, the K8s Cluster initially appears with a `CREATING` or `PROVISIONING` status. The control-plane nodes are provisioned according to the selected flavour. This process typically takes several minutes.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/k8s_logs_creating.png"
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/k8s_logs_creating.png"
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

You can check that the provisioning process is proceeding as expected on the Front-end command line using `onevm list`. Early in the provisioning process, you should see the [**Seed VM**]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/core_concepts/#seed-vm" %}}) in the `onevm list` output, this means that the provisioning process is proceeding as expected.  

```default
ID USER     GROUP    NAME                                      STAT  CPU  MEM   HOST            TIME
 5 oneadmin oneadmin general-standalone-controlplane-3-seed    prol    1   4G   ubuntu2204-host  0d 00h00
```

Run `onevm top` to view a continuously updated list of VMs, the seed VM will soon be accompanied by two further VMs, the virtual router and the control plane. This indicates that the provisioning process is proceeding as expected:

```default
ID USER     GROUP    NAME                                      STAT  CPU     MEM HOST              TIME
 7 oneadmin oneadmin test-cluster-zx299                        runn    2      4G ubuntu2204-host   0d 00h08
 6 oneadmin oneadmin vr-test-cluster-cp-0                      runn    1    512M ubuntu2204-host   0d 00h08
 5 oneadmin oneadmin general-standalone-controlplane-3-seed    prol    1      4G ubuntu2204-host   0d 00h00
```

Continue waiting until the K8s Cluster reaches the `RUNNING` state in the Sunstone **Kubernetes Logs** view.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/create_k8s_logs_running.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/create_k8s_logs_running.png" 
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

You can verify that the K8s Cluster is running using the `onevm list` command on the Front-end command line. You should still see the two newly created VMs, one for the virtual router and one for the control plane. The seed VM will terminate upon completion of the process:

```default
ID USER     GROUP    NAME                     STAT  CPU     MEM HOST                                             TIME
 2 oneadmin oneadmin test-cluster-nmhhb       runn    2      4G ubuntu2204-kvm-ssh-ks-7-2-f1wvx-2.test       0d 03h26
 1 oneadmin oneadmin vr-test-cluster-cp-0     runn    1    512M ubuntu2204-kvm-ssh-ks-7-2-f1wvx-1.test       0d 03h26
```

## Retrieve the Kubeconfig

After the K8s Cluster reaches the `RUNNING` state, you can retrieve its kubeconfig from the Sunstone Web UI. The kubeconfig contains the details and credentials needed for kubectl to interact with the K8s Cluster to deploy applications, manage pods and troubleshoot.

From **Kubernetes -> K8S Clusters**, open the target K8s Cluster. In the K8s Cluster detail view, select the **Kubeconfig** tab.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/k8s_kubeconfig.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/k8s_kubeconfig.png"
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

The kubeconfig content is displayed in the text area. Use the copy button to copy it, then save it locally as a file named `kubeconfig`. This kubeconfig file must be used with all subsequent kubectl commands. 

To use the kubeconfig file with kubectl commands, define the KUBECONFIG environment variable with an inline assignment before each command like so:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig kubectl get nodes
```

You should see the newly created K8s Cluster control-plane node in the output:

```default
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
test-cluster-nmhhb         Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   3h22m   v1.33.7+rke2r1
```

You can also export the KUBECONFIG environment variable at the beginning of a terminal session:

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig
```

Then subsequent kubectl commands can be run without the inline environment variable assignment. Caution is advised with this approach when dealing simultaneously with multiple K8s Clusters (and therefore multiple kubeconfig files).

## Add Worker Capacity

Node groups are the main operational unit for managing worker capacity in OneKS. After the K8s Cluster is running, you can add worker capacity by creating a node group from the Sunstone Web UI.

From **Kubernetes -> K8S Clusters**, open the target K8s Cluster. Select the **NodeGroup** tab, then click **Add Node Group**.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/k8s_add_node_group.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/k8s_add_node_group.png" 
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

The node-group creation wizard guides you through the required configuration steps:

* **General**: Node group name and optional description.  
* **Flavours**: Worker node flavour.  
* **User inputs**: Node count and remaining values required by the selected flavour.

In the **General** step, provide the basic node group information. Enter a node group name and, optionally, a description.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/k8s_node_group_name.png"
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/k8s_node_group_name.png" 
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

In **Flavours**, select the worker node flavour. The flavour defines the resource profile that will be used to deploy the worker nodes in this node group.

Available options include:

* **Small Worker Nodes**: Suitable for lightweight workloads.  
* **Medium Worker Nodes**: Suitable for balanced workloads.  
* **Large Worker Nodes**: Suitable for demanding workloads.

Each flavour shows its default resource configuration, such as CPU, memory, and disk size.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/k8s_choose_flavours.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/k8s_choose_flavours.png" 
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

In **User Inputs**, set the number of worker nodes to create. For example, set **Count** to `2` to create two worker nodes. The remaining fields, such as **CPU**, **Virtual CPU**, **Memory**, and **Disk Size**, are populated from the selected flavour.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/k8s_user_inputs.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/k8s_user_inputs.png" 
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

After finishing the wizard, you will be redirected to the **Kubernetes Logs** view, where you can monitor the node group provisioning process.

Wait until the node group reaches the `RUNNING` state and the K8s Cluster returns to `RUNNING`.

{{< image path="/images/oneks/light/k8s_logs_adding_node_group.png" 
          pathDark="/images/oneks/dark/k8s_logs_adding_node_group.png" 
alt="OneKS create K8s Cluster choose k8s version" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

From the OpenNebula Front-end machine command line, verify the new worker nodes with:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig kubectl get nodes
```

Example output:

```default
NAME                         STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
test-cluster-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   15m   v1.31.4
test-cluster-worker-1        Ready    <none>          3m    v1.31.4
test-cluster-worker-2        Ready    <none>          3m    v1.31.4
``` 

## Validate Workload Deployment and Service Connectivity

After the K8s Cluster nodes are in the `Ready` state, you can deploy a simple workload to verify that the K8s Cluster is functioning correctly.

Create a test `NGINX` pod:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig kubectl run nginx-test --image=nginx:stable --restart=Never
```

Expected output:

```default
pod/nginx-test created
```

Check the pod status:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig kubectl get pod nginx-test -o wide
```

Expected output:

```default
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE     
nginx-test   1/1     Running   0          27s   10.244.5.46   worker01 
```

This confirms that the K8s Cluster can schedule and start a workload on a worker node.

Expose the pod as a service:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig kubectl expose pod nginx-test --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=nginx-test
```

Create a temporary curl pod to test in-cluster service connectivity:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig kubectl run curl-test --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
           --rm -it --restart=Never -- curl -I http://nginx-test
```

Expected output:

```default
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.30.0
Date: Wed, 06 May 2026 08:56:45 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 896
Last-Modified: Tue, 14 Apr 2026 13:10:11 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "69de3cb3-380"
Accept-Ranges: bytes

pod "curl-test" deleted from default namespace
```

A `200` `OK` response confirms that the NGINX pod is running and reachable through the Kubernetes service. Completing this quick-start guide validates that basic workload scheduling, pod networking, DNS-based service discovery, and in-cluster connectivity are all working.
