OneKS provides Elastic Kubernetes as a Service on OpenNebula. It offers a structured way to create, access, operate, upgrade, recover, and deprovision Kubernetes Clusters (K8s Clusters) by combining a user-facing service layer with Cluster API-based infrastructure provisioning through CAPONE, the Cluster API provider for OpenNebula.

OneKS is designed for teams that need a simple and repeatable way to consume Kubernetes inside OpenNebula. Typical use cases include development and test environments, self-service Kubernetes delivery in private cloud environments, and standardized Cluster offerings for different sizes and topologies.

OneKS builds on CAPONE to expose a K8s Cluster-centric lifecycle model for users. Users interact mainly with OneKS K8s Clusters and node groups, while lower-level OpenNebula, Cluster API, and dependency-management details are handled underneath.

## How Should I Read this Chapter

If you have not used OneKS before, you should start by reading the [Basic Configuration Guide]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/basic_configuration/" %}}) to set up OneKS then follow the [Quick-start Guide]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/quick_start/" %}}) where you will learn to set up a basic K8s Cluster with OneKS. After completing the Quick-start Guide, move on to [Core Concepts]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/core_concepts/" %}}) to familiarize yourself with key OneKS concepts. 

After completing the introductory documentation, you can find more information about managing K8s Clusters with OneKS in the following reference documentation:

* [K8s Cluster Lifecycle Management]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/management/k8s_cluster_lifecycle_management/" %}})
* [Monitoring and Troubleshooting]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/management/monitoring_and_troubleshooting/" %}})
* [Configuration]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/management/configuration/" %}})
* [Profiles Customization]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/management/customizing_specs/" %}})
* [Service Architecture]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/references/architecture/" %}})
* [OneKS REST API]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/references/oneks_api/" %}})
* [OneKS CLI]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/references/oneks_cli/" %}})

{{< alert title="Note" type="primary" >}}
It is important while reading this documentation to differentiate the concepts of **OpenNebula Clusters** and **Kubernetes (K8s) Clusters**:
* **OpenNebula Clusters**: Logical groupings of OpenNebula resources (Hosts, datastores and Virtual Networks) that provide compute capacity for cloud workloads.
* **K8s Clusters**: Collections of node instances (VMs) managed by a K8s control plane to automate the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. 

K8s Clusters provisioned by OneKS run as a guest workload on top of OpenNebula resources and should be considered as distinct entities to OpenNebula Clusters. It is possible, for example, to deploy *multiple* independent K8s Clusters within a *single* OpenNebula Cluster.

## Interfaces

OneKS can be accessed through the following interfaces:

* **OneKS CLI**: Used for manual K8s Cluster and node-group operations from the command line.  
* **OneKS REST API**: Exposed under `/api/v1` for automation and programmatic integration.  
* **Sunstone Web UI**: Provides graphical workflows for creating, accessing, and managing OneKS K8s Clusters.

## What OneKS Manages

OneKS manages K8s Clusters as top-level resources. A K8s Cluster owns or coordinates:

* **Control Plane**: One logical control-plane group, containing one or more control-plane nodes depending on the selected control-plane flavour.  
* **Node Groups**: Zero or more worker-capacity groups attached to the K8s Cluster.  
* **Supporting Infrastructure**: Networks, images, VM templates, temporary seed VMs, virtual routers, and related OpenNebula resources.  
* **Lifecycle State**: The current operational state of the K8s Cluster and its groups.  
* **Historical Events**: Lifecycle actions and state transitions.  
* **Access Information**: kubeconfig retrieval for Kubernetes API access.  
* **Logs:** K8s Cluster-level and group-level lifecycle logs.

OneKS users interact primarily with the K8s Cluster and node-group domains. Lower-level OpenNebula, CAPONE, and Cluster API resources are orchestrated beneath those abstractions.

## Related Components

OneKS should be understood together with the following adjacent components:

* [**CAPONE**]({{% relref "product/integration_references/kubernetes/kubernetes_cluster_api/" %}}): The Cluster API provider for OpenNebula. It provides the lower-level declarative lifecycle integration between Kubernetes Cluster API and OpenNebula infrastructure.  
* [**OpenNebula Cloud Resources**]({{% relref "product/virtual_machines_operation/" %}}): VM templates, networks, images, virtual routers, and related infrastructure resources used to provision and operate the K8s Cluster.  
* [**RKE2**](https://docs.rke2.io/): The Kubernetes distribution used by the current OneKS implementation.  
* [**OneKS API**]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/references/oneks_api/" %}}): The programmatic interface for K8s Cluster and node-group lifecycle operations.  
* [**Kubernetes Cloud Provider**]({{% relref "product/integration_references/kubernetes/kubernetes_cloud_provider/" %}}): The in-cluster integration layer for OpenNebula infrastructure behavior.  
* [**OneGate**]({{% relref "product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/onegate/" %}}): The OpenNebula service used by Virtual Machines to communicate with OpenNebula during bootstrap and runtime configuration. In a OneKS deployment, OneGate must be configured and reachable so the K8s Cluster bootstrap process can complete successfully.  
* [**Transparent Proxy**]({{% relref "product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines_networking/tproxy/" %}}) `tproxy`: The OpenNebula networking configuration used to expose required OpenNebula services, such as OneGate and the XML-RPC API, through the Front-end public network OneKS deployments require tproxy rules for ports **5030** and **2633**.
* [**Cluster API References**]({{% relref "product/integration_references/kubernetes/kubernetes_cluster_api/" %}}): Useful when understanding the lower-level declarative lifecycle and CAPONE integration details.

## Supported Versions

OneKS supports the K8s versions exposed by the configured K8s Cluster profiles. Refer to the [Platform Notes]({{% relref "software/release_information/release_notes/platform_notes/#kubernetes" %}}) to see the Kubernetes versions currently supported bye OneKS.
