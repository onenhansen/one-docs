OneKS uses event-based monitoring to follow VM provisioning, deprovisioning, and lifecycle changes. Its current visibility model is centered on lifecycle state, events, and logs.

Event-driven monitoring is implemented through OpenNebula VM and dependency event watchers. It tracks VM allocation and state changes, seed VM state changes, and dependency lifecycle changes.

## K8s Cluster States

OneKS exposes the following K8s Cluster states:

## Reconciliation Rules

OneKS continuously reconciles the desired K8s Cluster state stored in OpenNebula documents with the observed state of the underlying groups, VMs, and dependencies. The K8s Cluster state is not updated in isolation, it is derived from the current lifecycle action and from the state of its control-plane and worker node groups.

| **Rule**                            | **Behavior** |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| Running condition               | A K8s Cluster reaches `RUNNING` only when all expected groups are `RUNNING`. |
| Group degradation               | A group in `WARNING` or a failure state may move the K8s Cluster to `WARNING` when the K8s Cluster resource still exists and the current action can continue being observed. |
| Action-specific failures        | Group failures are mapped to the K8s Cluster failure state that matches the operation in progress, such as `PROVISIONING_FAILURE`, `SCALING_FAILURE`, `UPGRADING_FAILURE`, or `DEPROVISIONING_FAILURE`. |
| Control-plane bootstrap failure | Seed VM or dependency failures during control-plane bootstrap can surface as `BOOTSTRAPPING_FAILURE` on the control-plane group and K8s Cluster. |
| Deprovisioning completion       | During deprovisioning, once the managed groups have been removed, the K8s Cluster reaches `DONE` and is removed from OneKS storage. |
| Terminal state                  | `DONE` is the terminal lifecycle state for a successfully deprovisioned K8s Cluster or node group. |

Operational constraints are also enforced during reconciliation:

| **Constraint**              | **Behavior** |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Node group creation     | Node groups can be added only when the K8s Cluster is in an operational state and the control plane is running. |
| Node group warning      | A node-group warning usually means that one or more associated VMs or dependencies are degraded, inconsistent, or not matching the expected state. |
| Control-plane scaling   | The control plane does not support scale operations through the OneKS scale command. |

## Troubleshooting Logs

OneKS provides two main log surfaces on the OpenNebula Front-end Host: service logs for the daemon itself, and lifecycle logs for each K8s Cluster.

Use the service logs when the OneKS server does not start, cannot connect to OpenNebula, fails to load configuration, or reports internal errors:

```default
/var/log/one/oneks.log
/var/log/one/oneks.error
```

Use the per-cluster lifecycle logs when a specific K8s Cluster fails or stalls during provisioning, scaling, upgrade, recovery, or deletion:

```default
/var/log/one/oneks/<cluster_id>.log
```

The CLI and API also expose the per-cluster lifecycle log. For daemon startup errors or configuration loading failures, use the service logs or the systemd journal for the OneKS service.

## Provisioning Troubleshooting

K8s Cluster provisioning can fail for different infrastructure or network-related reasons. In most cases, these failures surface as a timeout during provisioning and the K8s Cluster eventually moves to `PROVISIONING_FAILURE`. The following checks can help identify the most common causes.

### OneGate is Not Properly Configured

OneKS relies on the seed VM to report progress and update OpenNebula resources during provisioning. If OneGate is not properly configured or the seed VM cannot reach the OneGate service, the seed VM cannot publish the expected updates back to OpenNebula. As a result, OneKS waits until the provisioning timeout is reached and the K8s Cluster enters `PROVISIONING_FAILURE`.

Check that the OneGate service is running on the OpenNebula Front-end:

```shell
systemctl status opennebula-gate
journalctl -u opennebula-gate
```

Also check the OneGate service logs:

```shell
tail -n 200 /var/log/one/onegate.log
tail -n 200 /var/log/one/onegate.error
```

Verify that the VM template used by the seed VM includes OneGate contextualization, and that the VM receives a valid `ONEGATE_ENDPOINT` and token through context. The VM must also have network connectivity to the OneGate endpoint.

For more information, refer to the [OpenNebula OneGate Documentation]({{% relref "product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/onegate/" %}}).

### VMs Cannot Access the Internet

During provisioning, the seed VM needs Internet access to download the required artifacts and images used to bootstrap and connect the Kubernetes nodes. If the seed VM or the target nodes cannot reach the Internet, provisioning may stall until the timeout is reached and the K8s Cluster moves to `PROVISIONING_FAILURE`.

From the affected VM, check basic network connectivity:

```shell
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
```

Then check DNS resolution:

```shell
getent hosts opennebula.io
```

If IP connectivity works but DNS resolution fails, review the DNS configuration assigned to the VM. If both fail, review the router, gateway, NAT, and security group configuration of the public Virtual Network that the K8s Cluster has assigned.

For more information, refer to the [OpenNebula Virtual Networks Documentation]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/networking_system/manage_vnets/" %}}).

### VMs Cannot Communicate Through the Private Networks

The seed VM must be able to reach the control-plane VM through the private K8s Cluster network. If the private VNet is not correctly configured, the seed VM may create the control-plane VM successfully but fail when trying to connect to it and pivot the management K8s Cluster.

This usually indicates an issue in the private network configuration, such as missing routing, incorrect address assignment, security group restrictions, or lack of connectivity between the seed VM and the Kubernetes node private IPs.

From the seed VM, check connectivity to the control-plane private IP:

```shell
ping -c 3 <control_plane_private_ip>
```

Check whether SSH is reachable:

```shell
nc -vz <control_plane_private_ip> 22
```

If the control-plane VM is reachable only through the K8s Cluster virtual router created by OneKS, connect through the router as a jump Host:

```shell
ssh -J root@<router_public_ip> root@<control_plane_private_ip>
```

If the private IP cannot be reached, inspect the associated OpenNebula Virtual Networks, leases, security groups, and virtual router configuration. Make sure that the seed VM and the control-plane VM are attached to the expected networks and that traffic between them is allowed.

For more information, see the OpenNebula Virtual Networks documentation.

## Basic Kubernetes Troubleshooting 

Kubernetes-level checks are Cluster-specific. Start by retrieving the kubeconfig for the target K8s Cluster:

```shell
oneks show cluster <cluster_id> --kubeconfig > kubeconfig
```

Then verify the Kubernetes node state:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

A healthy K8s Cluster should show the expected control-plane and worker nodes in a `Ready` state.

If one or more nodes are `NotReady`, identify the affected OneKS group and OpenNebula VM: 

```shell
oneks show cluster <cluster_id>
oneks list nodegroups
oneks show nodegroup <nodegroup_id>
```

The OneKS output shows the VM IDs associated with the control-plane and each node group.

The OpenNebula Front-end cannot reach the Kubernetes node private network directly, connect through the K8s Cluster virtual router.

Identify the virtual router VM:

```shell
onevm list
```

Inspect the virtual router VM and identify its public-side virtual router IP:

```shell
onevm show <router_vm_id>
```

Use the public-side virtual router IP as the SSH jump Host and the node private IP as the final destination:

```shell
ssh -J root@<router_public_ip> root@<node_private_ip>
```

After connecting to the affected Kubernetes node VM, inspect the RKE2 service.

On a control-plane node:

```shell
systemctl status rke2-server --no-pager
journalctl -u rke2-server -n 200 --no-pager
```

On a worker node:

```shell
systemctl status rke2-agent --no-pager
journalctl -u rke2-agent -n 200 --no-pager
```

Run the `systemctl` and `journalctl` commands inside the affected Kubernetes node VM, not on the OpenNebula Front-end.
