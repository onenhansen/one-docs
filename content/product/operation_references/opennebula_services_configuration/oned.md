<!--# OpenNebula Configuration (oned) -->

The OpenNebula Daemon (`oned`) is the **core service of the cloud management platform**. It manages the cluster nodes, Virtual Networks and storages, groups, users and their Virtual Machines, and provides the XML-RPC API to other services and end users. The service is distributed as an operating system package `opennebula` with system service `opennebula`.

## Configuration

The OpenNebula Daemon configuration file can be found in `/etc/one/oned.conf` on the Front-end, and can be customized with the parameters listed in the table below.

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
After a configuration change, the OpenNebula Daemon must be [restarted]({{% relref "oned#oned-conf-service" %}}) to take effect.{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Tip" type="tip" >}}
For a quick view of any changes in configuration file options in maintenance releases, check the Resolved Issues page in the [Release Notes]({{% relref "../../../software/release_information/release_notes" %}}) for the release. Please note that even in the case of changes (such as a new option available), you do *not* need to update your configuration files unless you wish to change the application’s behavior.{{< /alert >}}

- `MANAGER_TIMER`: Time in seconds the core uses to evaluate periodical functions. `MONITORING_INTERVAL` cannot have a smaller value than `MANAGER_TIMER`.
- `MONITORING_INTERVAL_DATASTORE`: Time in seconds between each Datastore monitoring cycle.
- `MONITORING_INTERVAL_MARKET`: Time in seconds between each Marketplace monitoring cycle.
- `DS_MONITOR_VM_DISK`: Number of `MONITORING_INTERVAL_DATASTORE` intervals to monitor VM disks. `0` to disable. Only applies to `fs` and `fs_lvm` datastores.
- `SCRIPTS_REMOTE_DIR`: Remote path to store the monitoring and VM management script.
- `PORT`: Port where `oned` will listen for XML-RPC calls.
- `LISTEN_ADDRESS`: Host IP to listen for XML-RPC calls (default: all IPs).
- `HOSTNAME`: Hostname to use instead of autodetect it. This hostname is used to connect to Front-end during driver operations.
- `DB`: Vector of configuration attributes for the database backend.
  - `BACKEND`: Set to `sqlite` or `mysql`. Please see the [MySQL configuration guide]({{% relref "database#mysql" %}}) for more information.
  - `SERVER` (MySQL only): Host name or IP address of the MySQL server.
  - `USER` (MySQL only): MySQL user’s login ID.
  - `PASSWD` (MySQL only): MySQL user’s password.
  - `DB_NAME` (MySQL only): MySQL database name.
  - `COMPARE_BINARY` (MySQL only): compare strings using BINARY clause makes name searches case sensitive.
  - `ENCODING` (MySQL only): charset to use for the db connections.
  - `CONNECTIONS` (MySQL only): maximum number of connections to the MySQL server.
  - `TIMEOUT` (SQLite only): timeout in ms for acquiring lock to DB, should be at least 100 ms
  - `ERRORS_LIMIT`: number of consecutive DB errors to stop oned node in HA. Default `25`, use `-1` to disable this feature.
- `VNC_PORTS`: VNC port pool for automatic VNC port assignment. If possible, the port will be set to `START` + `VMID`. Refer to the [VM template reference]({{% relref "../configuration_references/template#template" %}}) for further information:
  - `START`: First port to assign.
  - `RESERVED`: Comma-separated list of reserved ports or ranges. Two numbers separated by a colon indicate a range.
- `VM_SUBMIT_ON_HOLD`: Forces VMs to be created on hold state instead of pending. Values: `YES` or `NO`.

- `CONTEXT_RESTRICTED_DIRS`: List of space-separated directories which can’t be used in `CONTEXT/FILES` attribute.
- `CONTEXT_SAFE_DIRS`: List of space-separated directories which allow use of subdirectories from `CONTEXT_RESTRICTED_DIRS`.
- `CONTEXT_ALLOW_ETH_UPDATES`: Allow manual updates of `CONTEXT->ETH*` values. It may lead to inconsistencies between VM NIC settings and context attributes, but it might be useful for some use cases. Default value = NO
- `LOG`: Configure the logging system
  - `SYSTEM`: Can be either `file` (default), `syslog` or `std`.
  - `USE_VMS_LOCATION`: Defines if store VM logs in VMS_LOCATION (`/var/lib/one/vms/<VMID>/vm.log`).

| `3`           | **DEBUG**   |

Here's an example of this section:

```default
#*******************************************************************************
# Daemon configuration attributes
#*******************************************************************************

LOG = [
  SYSTEM      = "file",
  DEBUG_LEVEL = 3,
  USE_VMS_LOCATION = "NO"
]

#MANAGER_TIMER = 15

MONITORING_INTERVAL_DATASTORE = 300
MONITORING_INTERVAL_MARKET    = 600

#DS_MONITOR_VM_DISK = 10

SCRIPTS_REMOTE_DIR=/var/tmp/one

.. _oned_conf_federation:
```

## Federation Configuration Attributes

Control the [federation capabilities of oned]({{% relref "../../control_plane_configuration/data_center_federation/overview#introf" %}}). Operation in a federated setup requires a special DB configuration.

- `FEDERATION`: Federation attributes.
  - `MODE`: Operation mode of this oned.
    - `STANDALONE`: Not federated. This is the default operational mode.
    - `MASTER`: This oned is the master Zone of the Federation.
    - `SLAVE`: This oned is a slave Zone.
- `ZONE_ID`: The Zone ID, as returned by the `onezone` command.
- `MASTER_ONED`: The XML-RPC endpoint of the master oned, e.g., `http://master.one.org:2633/RPC2`.

```default
#*******************************************************************************
# Federation configuration attributes
#*******************************************************************************

FEDERATION = [
    MODE = "STANDALONE",
    ZONE_ID = 0,
    MASTER_ONED = ""
]
```

## Raft Configuration Attributes

Opennebula uses the Raft algorithm. It can be tuned by the following options:

- `LIMIT_PURGE`: Number of DB log records that will be deleted on each purge.
- `LOG_RETENTION`: Number of DB log records kept. It determines the synchronization window across servers and extra storage space needed.
- `LOG_PURGE_TIMEOUT`: How often applied records are purged according to the log retention value (in seconds).
- `ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout to start an election process if no heartbeat or log is received from the leader (in milliseconds).
- `BROADCAST_TIMEOUT_MS`: How often heartbeats are sent to followers (in milliseconds).
- `XMLRPC_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout for Raft-related API calls (in milliseconds). For an infinite timeout, set this value to `0`.

Here's an example:

```default
RAFT = [
    LIMIT_PURGE          = 100000,
    LOG_RETENTION        = 500000,
    LOG_PURGE_TIMEOUT    = 600,
    ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS  = 2500,
    BROADCAST_TIMEOUT_MS = 500,
    XMLRPC_TIMEOUT_MS    = 450
]
```

## Default Showback Cost

The following attributes define the default cost for Virtual Machines that don’t have a CPU, MEMORY, or DISK costs. This is used by the [oneshowback calculate method]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/multitenancy/showback#showback" %}}).

```default
#*******************************************************************************
# Default showback cost
#*******************************************************************************

DEFAULT_COST = [
    CPU_COST    = 0,
    MEMORY_COST = 0,
    DISK_COST   = 0
]

SHOWBACK_ONLY_RUNNING = "no"
```

For showback the CPU and memory cost are counted if the resource is reserved on Host. That includes also `poweroff` and `suspend` states, when the VM is uploaded to the Host, the resources are reserved, but VM is not running. If you wish to count resources only for runnning VMs, set parameter `SHOWBACK_ONLY_RUNNING = "yes"`, default is `no`. The disk cost is always counted in `poweroff` and `suspend` states as the VM image is already uploaded to the Host.

<a id="oned-conf-xml-rpc-server-configuration"></a>

## XML-RPC Server Configuration

- `MAX_CONN`: Maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections the server will maintain.
- `MAX_CONN_BACKLOG`: Maximum number of TCP connections the operating system will accept on the server’s behalf without the server accepting them from the operating system.
- `KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT`: Maximum time in seconds that the server allows a connection to be open between RPCs.
- `KEEPALIVE_MAX_CONN`: Maximum number of RPCs that the server will execute on a single connection.
- `TIMEOUT`: Maximum time in seconds the server will wait for the client to do anything while processing an RPC. This timeout will also be used when a proxy calls to the master in a Federation.
- `RPC_LOG`: Create a separate log file for XML-RPC requests, in `/var/log/one/one_xmlrpc.log`.
- `MESSAGE_SIZE`: Buffer size in bytes for XML-RPC responses.
- `LOG_CALL_FORMAT`: Format string to log XML-RPC calls. Interpreted strings:
  - `%i` – request id
  - `%m` – method name
  - `%u` – user id
  - `%U` – user name
  - `%l[number]` – parameter list and number of characters (optional) to print each parameter, default is 20. Example: %l300
  - `%p` – user password
  - `%g` – group id
  - `%G` – group name
  - `%a` – auth token
  - `%%` – %
- `LOG_RESULT_LENGTH`: Max length of the API result log length, default is 20.

```default
#*******************************************************************************
# XML-RPC server configuration
#*******************************************************************************

#MAX_CONN           = 15
#MAX_CONN_BACKLOG   = 15
#KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT  = 15
#KEEPALIVE_MAX_CONN = 30
#TIMEOUT            = 15
#RPC_LOG            = NO
#MESSAGE_SIZE       = 1073741824
#LOG_CALL_FORMAT    = "Req:%i UID:%u %m invoked %l"
#LOG_RESULT_LENGTH  = 20
```

## Virtual Networks

- `NETWORK_SIZE`: Here you can define the default size for the Virtual Networks.
- `MAC_PREFIX`: Default MAC prefix to be used to create the auto-generated MAC addresses. (This can be overwritten by the Virtual Network template.)
- `VLAN_IDS`: VLAN ID pool for the automatic `VLAN_ID` assignment. This pool is for 802.1Q networks (Open vSwitch and 802.1Q drivers). The driver will try first to allocate `VLAN_IDS[START] + VNET_ID`
  - `START`: First `VLAN_ID` to use.
  - `RESERVED`: Comma-separated list of reserved VLAN_IDs or ranges. Two numbers separated by a colon indicate a range.
- `VXLAN_IDS`: Automatic VXLAN Network ID (VNI) assignment. This is used for `vxlan` networks.
  - `START`: First VNI to use.
  - Note: **Reserved is not supported by this pool**

Sample configuration:

```default
#*******************************************************************************
# Physical Networks configuration
#*******************************************************************************

NETWORK_SIZE = 254

MAC_PREFIX   = "02:00"

VLAN_IDS = [
    START    = "2",
    RESERVED = "0, 1, 4095"
]

VXLAN_IDS = [
    START = "2"
]
```

<a id="oned-conf-datastores"></a>

## Datastores

The [Storage Subsystem]({{% relref "../../cluster_configuration/storage_system/overview#sm" %}}) allows users to set up images, which can be operating systems or data, to be easily used in Virtual Machines. These images can be used by several Virtual Machines simultaneously and also shared with other users.

Here you can configure the default values for the Datastores and Image templates. There is more information about the template syntax [here]({{% relref "../configuration_references/img_template#img-template" %}}).

- `DATASTORE_LOCATION`: Path for Datastores. It is the same for all the Hosts and Front-end. It defaults to `/var/lib/one/datastores` (or in self-contained mode defaults to `$ONE_LOCATION/var/datastores`). Each Datastore has its own directory (called `BASE_PATH`) of the form: `$DATASTORE_LOCATION/<datastore_id>`. You can symlink this directory to any other path, if needed. `BASE_PATH` is generated from this attribute each time oned is started.
- `DATASTORE_CAPACITY_CHECK`: Check that there is enough capacity before creating a new image. Defaults to `yes`.
- `DEFAULT_IMAGE_TYPE`: Default value for `TYPE` field when it is omitted in a template. Values accepted are:
  - `OS`: Image file holding an operating system
  - `CDROM`: Image file holding a CDROM
  - `DATABLOCK`: Image file holding a datablock, created as an empty block
- `DEFAULT_DEVICE_PREFIX`: Default value for the `DEV_PREFIX` field when it is omitted in a template. The missing `DEV_PREFIX` attribute is filled when images are created, so changing this prefix won’t affect existing images. It can be set to:

| Prefix   | Device type     |
|----------|-----------------|
| `hd`     | IDE             |
| `sd`     | SCSI            |
| `vd`     | KVM virtio disk |
- `DEFAULT_CDROM_DEVICE_PREFIX`: Same as above but for CD-ROM devices.
- `DEFAULT_IMAGE_PERSISTENT`: Control the default value for the `PERSISTENT` attribute on image cloning or saving (`oneimage clone`, `onevm disk-saveas`). If omitted, images will inherit the `PERSISTENT` attribute from the base image.
- `DEFAULT_IMAGE_PERSISTENT_NEW`: Control the default value for the `PERSISTENT` attribute on image creation (`oneimage create`). By default images are not persistent if this is not set.
- `VM_SNAPSHOT_FACTOR`: Snapshot size is usually much smaller than original disk size. This attribute controls how much disk size should be counted for the VM snapshot. Value should be in range [0,1]. Default value for backward compatibility is 0.

More information on the image repository can be found in the [Managing Virtual Machine Images guide]({{% relref "../../virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/images#images" %}}).

Sample configuration:

```default
#*******************************************************************************
# Image Repository Configuration
#*******************************************************************************
#DATASTORE_LOCATION  = /var/lib/one/datastores

DATASTORE_CAPACITY_CHECK = "yes"

DEFAULT_IMAGE_TYPE    = "OS"
DEFAULT_DEVICE_PREFIX = "hd"

DEFAULT_CDROM_DEVICE_PREFIX = "hd"

#DEFAULT_IMAGE_PERSISTENT     = ""
#DEFAULT_IMAGE_PERSISTENT_NEW = "NO"
```

## Monitoring Daemon

The Monitoring Daemon gathers information from the cluster nodes. To define one, the following need to be set:

- **name**: name for this monitoring daemon.
- **executable**: path of the monitoring daemon as an absolute path or relative to `/usr/lib/one/mads/`. Default value `onemonitord`.
- **arguments**: for the daemon executable, usually a path to configuration file `-c monitord.conf`.
- **threads**: number of threads used for communication.

For more information on configuring the information and monitoring system, and hints to extend it, please check the [monitoring configuration]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/resource_monitoring/monitoring_system#mon-conf" %}}) and [information driver configuration guide]({{% relref "../../../product/integration_references/infrastructure_drivers_development/devel-im#devel-im" %}}).

Sample configuration:

```default
IM_MAD = [
      NAME          = "monitord",
      EXECUTABLE    = "onemonitord",
      ARGUMENTS     = "-c monitord.conf",
      THREADS       = 8
]
```

## Virtualization Drivers

The virtualization drivers are used to create, control, and monitor VMs on the Hosts. You can define more than one virtualization driver (e.g., you have different virtualizers in several Hosts) but make sure they have different names. To define one, the following need to be set:

- `NAME`: Name of the virtualization driver
- `SUNSTONE_NAME`: Name displayed in Sunstone
- `EXECUTABLE`: Path of the virtualization driver executable as an absolute path or relative to `/usr/lib/one/mads/`
- `ARGUMENTS`: For the driver executable

- `DEFAULT`: File containing default values and configuration parameters for the driver as an absolute path or relative to `/etc/one/`
- `KEEP_SNAPSHOTS`: Do not remove snapshots on power on/off cycles and live migrations if the hypervisor supports that
- `LIVE_RESIZE`: Hypervisor supports hotplug VCPU and memory. Values: `YES` or `NO`
- `SUPPORT_SHAREABLE`: Hypervisor supports shareable disks. Values: `YES` or `NO`

There are some non-mandatory attributes:

- `DS_LIVE_MIGRATION`: live migration between datastores is allowed
- `COLD_NIC_ATTACH`: NIC attach/detach in poweroff state calls networks scripts (`pre`, `post`, `clean`) and virtualization driver attach/detach actions

For more information on configuring and setting up the Virtual Machine Manager Driver please check the section relevant to you:

* [KVM Driver]({{% relref "../../../product/operation_references/hypervisor_configuration/kvm_driver.md#kvmg" %}})

Sample configuration:

```default
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Virtualization Driver Configuration
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VM_MAD = [
    NAME           = "kvm",
    SUNSTONE_NAME  = "KVM",
    EXECUTABLE     = "one_vmm_exec",
    ARGUMENTS      = "-t 15 -r 0 kvm",
    DEFAULT        = "vmm_exec/vmm_exec_kvm.conf",
    TYPE           = "kvm",
    KEEP_SNAPSHOTS = "no",
    LIVE_RESIZE    = "yes",
    SUPPORT_SHAREABLE    = "yes"
]
```

<a id="oned-conf-transfer-driver"></a>

## Transfer Driver

The transfer drivers are used to transfer, clone, remove, and create VM images. The default `TM_MAD` driver includes plugins for all supported storage modes. You may need to modify the `TM_MAD` to add custom plugins.

- `EXECUTABLE`: path of the transfer driver executable, as an absolute path or relative to `/usr/lib/one/mads/`
- `ARGUMENTS`: for the driver executable:
  - `-t`: number of threads, i.e., number of transfers made at the same time
  - `-d`: list of transfer drivers separated by commas. If not defined all the drivers available will be enabled

For more information on configuring different storage alternatives please check the [storage configuration]({{% relref "../../cluster_configuration/storage_system/overview#sm" %}}) guide.

Sample configuration:

```default
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Transfer Manager Driver Configuration
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TM_MAD = [
    EXECUTABLE = "one_tm",
    ARGUMENTS = "-t 15 -d dummy,lvm,shared,fs_lvm,qcow2,ssh,local,ceph,dev,iscsi_libvirt"
]
```

The configuration for each driver is defined in the `TM_MAD_CONF` section.

{{< alert title="Important" type="info" >}}
These values define the datastore behavior and thus should not be modified. They are used when creating a new datastore of given type and also when developing new drivers.{{< /alert >}}

- `NAME`: name of the transfer driver, listed in the `-d` option of the `TM_MAD` section
- `LN_TARGET`: determines how persistent images will be cloned when a new VM is instantiated:
  - `NONE`: The image will be linked and no more storage capacity will be used
  - `SELF`: The image will be cloned in the Images datastore
  - `SYSTEM`: The image will be cloned in the System datastore
- `CLONE_TARGET`: determines how non-persistent images will be cloned when a new VM is instantiated:
  - `NONE`: The image will be linked and no more storage capacity will be used
  - `SELF`: The image will be cloned in the Images datastore
  - `SYSTEM`: The image will be cloned in the System datastore
- `SHARED`: determines if the storage holding the system datastore is shared among the different Hosts or not. Valid values: `yes` or `no`
- `DS_MIGRATE`: set to `YES` if system datastore migrations are allowed for this TM. Only useful for system datastore TMs
- `ALLOW_ORPHANS`: Whether snapshots can live without parents:
  > - `YES`: The snapshot will be attempted to be deleted even if it has children
  > - `NO`: The snapshot will not be attempted to be deleted if it has children
  > - `MIXED`: Creates children snapshots from the current active (last recovered) snapshot.  This also takes into account some dependencies which can appear after a revert snapshot action in Ceph datastores
  > - `FORMAT`: Allows orphans based on the image format in a `SHARED` datastore. For `QCOW2` this acts as `NO` and for `RAW` this acts as `YES`

Sample configuration:

```default
TM_MAD_CONF = [
    NAME          = "lvm",
    LN_TARGET     = "NONE",
    CLONE_TARGET  = "SELF",
    SHARED        = "yes",

]
```

## Hook System

Hooks in OpenNebula are programs (usually scripts) whose execution is triggered by a change in state in Virtual Machines or Hosts. The hooks can be executed either locally or remotely to the node where the VM or Host is running. To configure the Hook System the following needs to be set in the OpenNebula configuration file:

- `EXECUTABLE`: path of the hook driver executable as an absolute path or relative to `/usr/lib/one/mads/`
- `ARGUMENTS`: for the driver executable as an absolute path or relative to `/etc/one/`

<a id="oned-auth-manager-conf"></a>

## Auth Manager Configuration

- `AUTH_MAD`: The [driver]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/authentication_configuration/overview#external-auth" %}}) that will be used to authenticate and authorize OpenNebula requests. If not defined, OpenNebula will use the built-in authorization policies
  - `EXECUTABLE`: path of the auth driver executable as an absolute path or relative to `/usr/lib/one/mads/`
  - `AUTHN`: list of authentication modules, separated by commas. If not defined, all the modules available will be enabled
  - `AUTHZ`: list of authorization modules, separated by commas
- `SESSION_EXPIRATION_TIME`: Time in seconds for which an authenticated token is valid. During this time the driver is not used. Use `0` to disable session caching
- `ENABLE_OTHER_PERMISSIONS`: Whether or not to enable the permissions for ‘other’. Users in the oneadmin group will still be able to change these permissions. Values: `YES` or `NO`
- `DEFAULT_UMASK`: Similar to Unix umask. Sets the default resource permissions. Its format must be 3 octal digits. For example, a umask of 137 will set the new object’s permissions to 640 `um- u-- ---`.

Sample configuration:

```default
AUTH_MAD = [
    executable = "one_auth_mad",
    authn = "ssh,x509,ldap,server_cipher,server_x509,saml"
]

SESSION_EXPIRATION_TIME = 900

#ENABLE_OTHER_PERMISSIONS = "YES"

DEFAULT_UMASK = 177
```

The `DEFAULT_AUTH` can be used to point to the desired default authentication driver, for example `ldap` or `saml`:

```default

## VM Operations Permissions

The following parameters define the operations associated with the **ADMIN**,
**MANAGE**, and **USE** permissions. Note that some VM operations may require additional
permissions on other objects. Also, some operations refer to a class of
actions:

- `disk-snapshot`: includes `create`, `delete`, and `revert` actions
- `disk-attach`: includes `attach` and `detach` actions
- `nic-attach`: includes `attach`, `detach`, and `nic-update` actions
- `snapshot`: includes `create`, `delete`, and `revert` actions
- `resched`: includes `resched` and `unresched` actions
- `migrate`: includes `migrate`, `live-migrate`, and `poweroff migrate` actions
- `sg-attach`: includes `attach` and `detach` actions
- `sched-action`: includes `add`, `delete`, and `update` actions

The list and show operations require **USE** permission; this is not configurable.

In the following example you need **ADMIN** rights on a VM to perform `migrate`, `delete`, `recover` … while `undeploy`, `hold`, … need **MANAGE** rights:

```default
VM_ADMIN_OPERATIONS  = "migrate, delete, recover, retry, deploy, resched, backup"

VM_MANAGE_OPERATIONS = "undeploy, hold, release, stop, suspend, resume, reboot,
    poweroff, disk-attach, nic-attach, disk-snapshot, terminate, disk-resize,
    snapshot, updateconf, rename, resize, update, disk-saveas, sched-action, sg-attach"

VM_USE_OPERATIONS    = ""
```

## Generic Quota Configuration

Generic quota attributes used for [Compute Quotas]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/capacity_planning/quotas#quota-auth" %}}). You can impose quota limits to any numerical attribute from the Virtual Machine Template or User Template. Sample configuration:

```default
QUOTA_VM_ATTRIBUTE = "VCPU"
QUOTA_VM_ATTRIBUTE = "LICENSE"
```

Note that any generic quota attribute will be added to the `VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR` set (see below).

## Restricted Attributes Configuration

Users outside the `oneadmin` group won’t be able to instantiate templates created by users outside the `oneadmin` group that include attributes restricted by:

- `VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR`: Virtual Machine attribute to be restricted for users outside the oneadmin group
- `IMAGE_RESTRICTED_ATTR`: Image attribute to be restricted for users outside the oneadmin group
- `VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR`: Virtual Network attribute to be restricted for users outside the oneadmin group when updating a reservation. These attributes are not considered for regular VNET creation.

If the VM template has been created by admins in the `oneadmin` group then users outside the oneadmin group **can** instantiate these templates.

Sample configuration:

```default
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "CONTEXT/FILES"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "NIC/MAC"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "NIC/VLAN_ID"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "NIC/BRIDGE"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "NIC_DEFAULT/MAC"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "NIC_DEFAULT/VLAN_ID"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "NIC_DEFAULT/BRIDGE"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/TOTAL_BYTES_SEC"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/READ_BYTES_SEC"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/WRITE_BYTES_SEC"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/TOTAL_IOPS_SEC"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/READ_IOPS_SEC"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/WRITE_IOPS_SEC"
#VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/SIZE"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK/ORIGINAL_SIZE"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "CPU_COST"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "MEMORY_COST"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "DISK_COST"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "PCI"
VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "USER_INPUTS"

#VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "RANK"
#VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "SCHED_RANK"
#VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "REQUIREMENTS"
#VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "SCHED_REQUIREMENTS"

IMAGE_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "SOURCE"

VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "VN_MAD"
VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "PHYDEV"
VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "VLAN_ID"
VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "BRIDGE"

VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "AR/VN_MAD"
VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "AR/PHYDEV"
VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "AR/VLAN_ID"
VNET_RESTRICTED_ATTR = "AR/BRIDGE"
```

OpenNebula evaluates these attributes:

- on VM template create (`onetemplate create`)
- on VM template instantiate (`onetemplate instantiate`)
- on VM template update (`onetemplate update`)
- on VM create (`onevm create`)
- on VM update (`onevm update`)
- on VM update configuration (`onevm updateconf`)
- on VM resize (`onevm resize`)
- on VM attach disk (`onevm disk-attach`)
- on VM attach NIC (`onevm nic-attach`), for example, to prevent using `NIC/MAC`

<a id="encrypted-attrs"></a>

## Encrypted Attributes Configuration

These attributes are encrypted and decrypted by the OpenNebula core. The supported attributes are:

- `CLUSTER_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`
- `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`
- `DATASTORE_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`
- `HOST_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`
- `VM_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`: these attributes apply also to the user template.
- `VNET_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`: these attributes apply also to address ranges which belong to the Virtual Network.
- `USER_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`
- `IMAGE_ENCRYPTED_ATTR`

Sample configuration:

```default
DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTED_ATTR = "PROVISION_BODY"

HOST_ENCRYPTED_ATTR = "AZ_ID"
HOST_ENCRYPTED_ATTR = "AZ_CERT"
HOST_ENCRYPTED_ATTR = "ONE_PASSWORD"

VM_ENCRYPTED_ATTR = "ONE_PASSWORD"
VM_ENCRYPTED_ATTR = "CONTEXT/PASSWORD"
```

OpenNebula encrypts these attributes:

- on object create (`onecluster/onedatastore/onehost/onevm/onevnet create`)
- on object update (`onecluster/onedatastore/onehost/onevm/onevnet update`)

To decrypt the attribute you need to use the `info` API method with `true` as a parameter. You can decrypt the attributes using the `--decrypt` option for `onevm show`, `onehost show`, and `onevnet show`.

## Inherited Attributes Configuration

The following attributes will be copied from the resource template to the instantiated VMs. More than one attribute can be defined.

- `INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR`: Attribute to be copied from the Image template to each `VM/DISK`.
- `INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR`: Attribute to be copied from the Datastore template to each `VM/DISK`.
- `INHERIT_VNET_ATTR`: Attribute to be copied from the Network template to each `VM/NIC`.

Sample configuration:

```default
#INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR     = "EXAMPLE"
#INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR     = "SECOND_EXAMPLE"
#INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR = "COLOR"
#INHERIT_VNET_ATTR      = "BANDWIDTH_THROTTLING"

INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "CEPH_HOST"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "CEPH_SECRET"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "CEPH_USER"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "CEPH_CONF"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "POOL_NAME"

INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "ISCSI_USER"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "ISCSI_USAGE"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "ISCSI_HOST"

INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR      = "ISCSI_USER"
INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR      = "ISCSI_USAGE"
INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR      = "ISCSI_HOST"
INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR      = "ISCSI_IQN"

INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "GLUSTER_HOST"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "GLUSTER_VOLUME"

INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "DISK_TYPE"
INHERIT_DATASTORE_ATTR  = "ADAPTER_TYPE"

INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR      = "DISK_TYPE"
INHERIT_IMAGE_ATTR      = "ADAPTER_TYPE"

INHERIT_VNET_ATTR       = "VLAN_TAGGED_ID"
INHERIT_VNET_ATTR       = "FILTER_IP_SPOOFING"
INHERIT_VNET_ATTR       = "FILTER_MAC_SPOOFING"
INHERIT_VNET_ATTR       = "MTU"
INHERIT_VNET_ATTR       = "METRIC"
INHERIT_VNET_ATTR       = "CVLANS"
INHERIT_VNET_ATTR       = "QINQ_TYPE"
```

<a id="oned-conf-onegate"></a>

## OneGate Configuration

- `ONEGATE_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint where OneGate will be listening. Optional.

Sample configuration:

```default
ONEGATE_ENDPOINT = "http://192.168.0.5:5030"
```

## Default Permissions for VDC ACL Rules

Default ACL rules created when a resource is added to a VDC. The following attributes configure the permissions granted to the VDC group for each resource type:

- `DEFAULT_VDC_HOST_ACL`: permissions granted on Hosts added to a VDC.
- `DEFAULT_VDC_NET_ACL`: permissions granted on vnets added to a VDC.
- `DEFAULT_VDC_DATASTORE_ACL`: permissions granted on datastores to a VDC.
- `DEFAULT_VDC_CLUSTER_HOST_ACL`: permissions granted to cluster Hosts when a cluster is added to the VDC.
- `DEFAULT_VDC_CLUSTER_NET_ACL`: permissions granted to cluster vnets when a cluster is added to the VDC.
- `DEFAULT_VDC_CLUSTER_DATASTORE_ACL`: permissions granted to a datastores added to a cluster.

When defining the permissions you can use `""` or `"-"` to avoid adding any rule to that specific resource. Also, you can combine several permissions with `"+"`, for example `"MANAGE+USE"`. Valid permissions are **USE**, **MANAGE**, or **ADMIN**.

Example:

```default
DEFAULT_VDC_HOST_ACL      = "MANAGE"
#Adds @<gid> HOST/#<hid> MANAGE #<zid> when a Host is added to the VDC.
onevdc addhost <vdc> <zid> <hid>

DEFAULT_VDC_NET_ACL       = "USE"
#Adds @<gid> NET/#<vnetid> USE #<zid> when a vnet is added to the VDC.
onevdc addvnet <vdc> <zid> <vnetid>

DEFAULT_VDC_DATASTORE_ACL = "USE"
#Adds @<gid> DATASTORE/#<dsid> USE #<zid> when a vnet is added to the VDC.
onevdc adddatastore <vdc> <zid> <dsid>

DEFAULT_VDC_CLUSTER_HOST_ACL      = "MANAGE"
DEFAULT_VDC_CLUSTER_NET_ACL       = "USE"
DEFAULT_VDC_CLUSTER_DATASTORE_ACL = "USE"
#Adds:
#@<gid> HOST/%<cid> MANAGE #<zid>
#@<gid> DATASTORE+NET/%<cid> USE #<zid>
#when a cluster is added to the VDC.
onevdc addcluster <vdc> <zid> <cid>
```

## Service Control and Logs

Change the server running state by managing the operating system service `opennebula`.

To start, restart, stop the server, execute one of:

```default
# systemctl start   opennebula
# systemctl restart opennebula
# systemctl stop    opennebula
```

To enable or disable automatic start upon Host boot, execute one of:

```default
# systemctl enable  opennebula
# systemctl disable opennebula
```

Server **logs** are located in `/var/log/one` in the following files:

- `/var/log/one/oned.log`
- `/var/log/one/one_xmlrpc.log` (optional, if `RPC_LOG` enabled)

Logs of individual VMs can be found in

- `/var/log/one/$ID.log` where `$ID` identifies the VM

Other logs are also available in Journald, use the following command to show these:

```default
# journalctl -u opennebula.service
```
