### Hosts SAN Configuration

The abstraction required to access LUNs consists of block devices. This means that there are several ways to set them up, although it usually involves using a network block protocol such as iSCSI or Fibre Channel, as well as some form of path redundancy, such as DM Multipath.

Hypervisor hosts acting as SCSI initiators must be configured according to the storage vendor's documentation and recommended best practices. The exact implementation may vary depending on the storage platform, access protocol (iSCSI or Fibre Channel), and multipathing requirements. Vendor-specific guidance should always take precedence over generic operating system configuration procedures.

The following example illustrates a generic iSCSI and DM Multipath configuration on Linux hosts and is provided for reference purposes only.

```
# === ISCSI ===

TARGET_IP="192.168.1.100"                             # IP of SAN appliance

    user_friendly_names yes
    find_multipaths yes
}
# Optional: blacklist local boot disks if needed
# blacklist {
#     devnode "^sd[a-z]"
# }
EOF

# === Reload multipath ===
sudo multipath -F    # Flush existing config (safely if not in use)

## Front-end Configuration

The Front-end needs access to the shared SAN server in order to perform LVM operations. It can
either access it directly, or using some host(s) as proxy/bridge.

For direct access, **the Front-end will need to be configured in the same way as hosts**, and no
further configuration will be needed. Example for illustration purposes:

```
-------------
| Front-end | ---- /dev/mapper/mpath* ------+
-------------     (iSCSI + multipath)       |
                                            |
                                            v
  ---------                              --------------
  | host2 | ---- /dev/mapper/mpath* ---> | SAN server |
  ---------     (iSCSI + multipath)      --------------
                                            ^
                                            |
  ---------                                 |
  | hostN | ---- /dev/mapper/mpath* --------+
  ---------     (iSCSI + multipath)
```

Alternatively, delegate front-end SAN operations to one or more specific hosts by setting the `BRIDGE_LIST` attribute in the System datastore. The front-end refers to one of the hosts in the list to proxy SAN operations. Only a reduced set of operations are initiated in the front-end, such as the ones intended for undeployed VMs.

## Troubleshooting

### LVM Devices File

**Problem:** LVM does not show my iSCSI/multipath devices (with e.g., `pvs`), although I can see them
with `multipath -ll` or `lsblk`.

**Possible solution:**

The LVM version in some operating systems or Linux distributions, by default,
doesn't scan the whole `/dev` directory for possible disks. Instead, you need to explicitly
**whitelist** them in `/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices`. You can check whether that's your case by
running:

```
lvmconfig --type full devices/use_devicesfile
```

If it returns `devices/use_devicesfile=1`, then the devices file is being used and enforced. In that
case, just add the device path to the whitelist and check again:

```
# echo /dev/mapper/mpatha >> /etc/lvm/devices/system.devices
# pvs
```

### Pool becomes full after live datastore migration

**Problem:** After a live datastore migration between two `fs_lvm_ssh` datastores with `LVM_THIN_ENABLE=yes` the disk now shows full:

```
# lvs
  LV             VG       Attr       LSize   Pool           Origin Data%  Meta%
  lv-one-11-0    vg-one-0 Vwi-aotz-k 256.00m lv-one-11-pool        100.00
  lv-one-11-pool vg-one-0 twi---tz-k 256.00m                       100.00 12.60
```

**Impact:** Everything should work as expected. The 100% in the `Data%` column only signifies that the thin volume is using the full space allocated by the pool. The filesystem is not affected and maintains the same space available as before. However, if that figure is used for monitoring, this should be taken into account to avoid false positives.

**Explaination:** The libvirt operation that implements live migration between datastores ([blockcopy](https://www.libvirt.org/manpages/virsh.html#blockcopy)) copied all blocks in the source LV, including the empty ones. This is due to the copy being made between raw block devices that don't expose information about empty blocks; LVM returns zero-filled blocks when reading from an unallocated part of the volume. For some operations like [migrate](https://www.libvirt.org/manpages/virsh.html#migrate), libvirt is able to detect blocks consisting of only zeroes and omit them by using the `--migrate-disks-detect-zeroes` option. Currently that option is not available on the `blockcopy` command.

**Mitigation:** If for any reason this situation unacceptable, an offline datastore migration should fix the issue (until libvirt supports the `--migrate-disks-detect-zeroes` option detailed above). A different mechanism is used for that case (`dd` with `conv=sparse`) which omits empty blocks from the copy.
