<!--# Hosts -->

In order to use your existing physical nodes, you have to add them to OpenNebula as Hosts. To add a Host only its hostname and type is needed.

{{< alert title="Warning" type="warning" >}}
Before adding a Linux Host check that you can SSH to it without being prompted for a password.{{< /alert >}}

## Creating and Deleting Hosts

Hosts are the servers managed by OpenNebula responsible for running VMs. To use these Hosts in OpenNebula you need to register them so they are monitored and made available to the scheduler.

Creating a Host:

```default
$ onehost create host01 --im kvm --vm kvm
ID: 0
```

The parameters are:

* `--im`: Information Manager driver.
* `--vm`: Virtual Machine Manager driver.

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
In the examples included in this guide we’ll use KVM as the hypervisor. Note that the procedure will be the same for any other hypervisor; only the name will need to be changed.{{< /alert >}} 

To remove a Host you can either specify it by ID or by name. The following commands are equivalent:

```default
$ onehost delete host01
$ onehost delete 0
```

## Showing and Listing Hosts

To display information about a single Host, use the `show` command:

```default
$ onehost show server

The information of a Host contains:

* **General information** of the Host including its name and the drivers used to interact with it.
* **Capacity** (*Host Shares*) for CPU and memory.
* **Local datastore information** (*Local System Datastore*) if the Host is configured to use a local datastore (e.g., in Local transfer mode).
* **Monitoring Information**, including PCI devices and NUMA information of the node. You can also find hypervisor specific information here.
* **Virtual Machines** allocated to the Host. *Wild* are Virtual Machines running on the Host but not started by OpenNebula.

To see a list of all the Hosts:

```default
$ onehost list

```

The above information can be also displayed in XML, JSON, or CSV format using `-x` or `-j` or `-c`, respectively.

## Host States

In order to manage the life cycle of a Host it can be set to different operation modes: enabled (`on`), disabled (`dsbl`), and offline (`off`). The different operation status for each mode is described in the following table:

## Host Operations

The `onehost` tool provides commands to set the operation mode of a Host: `disable`, `offline`, and `enable`, for example:

```default
$ onehost disable 0
```

To re-enable the Host, use the `enable` command:

```default
$ onehost enable 0
```

Similarly, to take the Host offline:

```default
$ onehost offline 0
```

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
`onehost disable` and `onehost offline` do not change the state of VMs already running on the Host. If you need to automatically migrate running VMs use `onehost flush`.{{< /alert >}} 

Apart from the commands above, the `onehost` tool also provides some commands that allow you to easily perform common operations on a Host.

You can use `forceupdate` subcommand to reset the monitoring process on the Host:

```default
$ onehost forceupdate 0
```

The `flush` command will migrate all the active VMs in the specified Host to another server with enough capacity. At the same time, the specified Host will be disabled so no more Virtual Machines are deployed in it. This command is useful to clean a Host of active VMs. The migration process can be done by a `resched` action or by a recover `delete-recreate` action; it can be configured in `/etc/one/cli/onehost.yaml` by setting the field `default_actions\flush` to `delete-recreate` or to `resched`. Here is an example:

```default
:default_actions:
  - :flush: delete-recreate
```

### Custom Host Attributes

You can add custom attributes either by [creating a probe in the host]({{% relref "../../../product/integration_references/infrastructure_drivers_development/devel-im#devel-im" %}}) or by updating the Host information with: `onehost update`.

For example, to label a Host as *production* we can add a custom tag *TYPE*:

```default
$ onehost update
...
TYPE="production"
```

This tag can be used at a later time for scheduling purposes, [see more details here]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/scheduler" %}}).

<a id="host-guide-sync"></a>

### Updating Host Files

When OpenNebula monitors a Host it copies driver files to `/var/tmp/one`. When these files are updated they need to be copied again to the Hosts with the `sync` command. To keep track of the probes version there’s a file in `/var/lib/one/remotes/VERSION`. By default this holds the OpenNebula version (e.g., ‘7.0.0’). This version can be seen in the Hosts by using `onehost show <host>`:

```default
$ onehost show 0
HOST 0 INFORMATION
ID                    : 0
[...]
MONITORING INFORMATION
VERSION="7.0.0"
[...]
```

The command `onehost sync` only updates the Hosts with `VERSION` lower than the one in the file `/var/lib/one/remotes/VERSION`. In case you modify the probes this `VERSION` file should be modified with a greater value, for example “7.0.0.1”.

In case you want to force an upgrade, that is, without any `VERSION` checking, you can do it by using the `--force` option:

```default
$ onehost sync --force
```

You can also select which Hosts you want to upgrade by naming them or selecting a cluster:

```default
$ onehost sync host01,host02,host03
$ onehost sync -c myCluster
```

### PCI Devices

The monitoring information for a Host includes details about all PCI devices detected on the node. This is particularly useful for [PCI passthrough]({{% relref "pci_passthrough" %}}) configurations, where specific devices need to be assigned to Virtual Machines. PCI devices are discovered by the Information Manager probe and can be filtered using the configuration in `/var/lib/one/remotes/etc/im/kvm-probes.d/pci.conf`.

Each PCI device reported by the monitor contains the following attributes:

| Attribute       | Type    | Present             | Description                                                                                                    |

#### IFNAME Resolution

The `IFNAME` attribute is resolved using multiple methods, following this precedence (first match is used):

1. **udev rules** — reads `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-rename.rules`, looking for specially formatted comments. This file is automatically generated by [OneDeploy]({{% relref "../../../solutions/ai_factory_blueprints/deployment/cd_on-premises.md" %}}) and is not intended to be edited manually. It is used to assign persistent names to network interfaces, either for convenience (custom names) or to prevent losing the standard name after VFIO takes control of the device.
2. **File cache** — consults `/var/tmp/one_db/pci_net_names/<PCI_ADDRESS>`, where each file (named as the PCI address) contains the interface name. Created automatically on first resolution.
3. **Direct sysfs lookup** — reads the directory `/sys/bus/pci/devices/<PCI_ADDRESS>/net/` to find the kernel interface name.

The cache is cleared when the monitoring daemon restarts.

## Wild VMs

The monitoring mechanism in OpenNebula reports all VMs found in a hypervisor, even those not launched through OpenNebula. These VMs are referred to as Wild VMs. The Wild VMs can be spotted through the `onehost show` command:

```default
$ onehost show 3
HOST 3 INFORMATION

```

{{< alert title="Warning" type="warning" >}}
Wild VMs’ support and limitations may differ depending on the virtualization driver used (e.g., KVM or LXC). In order to find more specific information for the virtualization driver you’re using, please check the corresponding driver guide.{{< /alert >}}

## Using Sunstone to Manage Hosts

You can also manage your Hosts using [Sunstone UI Interface]({{% relref "../../control_plane_configuration/graphical_user_interface/fireedge_sunstone#fireedge-sunstone" %}}). Select the Host tab and there you will be able to create, enable, disable, delete, and see information about your Hosts in a user-friendly way.
