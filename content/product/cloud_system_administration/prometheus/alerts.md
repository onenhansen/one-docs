<!--# Alert Manager -->

## Installation and Configuration

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
If you are already running the Prometheus AlertManager you can skip this section and add the alarms described in the next section to your rules file.{{< /alert >}} 

AlertManager is part of the Prometheus distribution and should already be installed in your system after completing the installation process, [see more details here]({{% relref "install#monitor-alert-installation" %}}).

Now you just need to enable and start the AlertManager service:

```default
# systemctl enable --now opennebula-alertmanager.service
```

The configuration file for the AlertManager can be found in `/etc/one/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`. By default, the only receiver configured is a webhook listening on a local port. AlertManager includes several options to notify the alarms, please refer to the [Prometheus documentation on Alerting Configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/) to setup your own receiver.

```yaml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 1h
  receiver: 'web.hook'
receivers:
  - name: 'web.hook'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/'
inhibit_rules:
  - source_match:
      severity: 'critical'
    target_match:
      severity: 'warning'
    equal: ['alertname', 'dev', 'instance']
```

## Alerts Rules

We provide some pre-defined alert rules that cover the most common use cases for an OpenNebula cloud. These rules are not intended to use as-is, but as a starting point to define the alert situations for your specific use case.  Please [review the Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) to adapt the provided alert rules.

Alert Rules can be found in `/etc/one/prometheus/rules.yml`.

## Setting up Alarms for OpenNebula in HA

{{< alert title="Important" type="info" >}}
To avoid duplicate alert notifications you should configure **all** your alertmanager instances to run in HA mode,{{< /alert >}} 
then point **all** your prometheus instances to them.

Please refer to the [Using Prometheus with OpenNebula in HA]({{% relref "install#monitor-alert-ha" %}}) section for details.

## Alerts for the Optional Exporters

The shipped `rules.yml` only covers the four base metric sources (Prometheus, OpenNebula, Libvirt, Node). If you install any of the [optional exporters]({{% relref "install#monitor-alert-extra-exporters" %}}), you can add your own rules using their metric prefixes (e.g. `mysql_up == 0` for `mysql_exporter`, `ovs_status` for `ovs_exporter`). See the upstream documentation linked in the [metrics reference]({{% relref "metrics#monitor-alert-metrics" %}}) for the available series.
