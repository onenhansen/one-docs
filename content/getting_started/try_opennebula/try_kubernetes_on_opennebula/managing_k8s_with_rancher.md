## Overview

In this tutorial, we will deploy a Kubernetes Cluster using the [Kubernetes Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/introduction) (CAPI) and the [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com) Kubernetes management platform through the [OpenNebula Kubernetes (CAPI) appliance](https://marketplace.opennebula.io/appliance/c33522e7-7b7e-4046-bc23-833797431bf0).

To follow this tutorial, you must first complete the miniONE installation with either on-prem resources meeting the relevant hardware requirements or an AWS `c5.metal` instance:

* [miniONE on-prem installation]({{% relref "deploy_opennebula_onprem_with_minione" %}})
* [miniONE AWS installation]({{% relref "deploy_opennebula_on_aws" %}})

During this tutorial you will complete the following high-level steps:

1. Configure a public and private network on the Front-end
1. Download the CAPI Appliance
1. Instantiate the CAPI Appliance
1. Connect to the Rancher UI
1. Deploy an OpenNebula RKE2 Cluster
1. Import the Cluster into Rancher

Additionally, you will perform various operations on the workload Cluster:
  - Install Longhorn
  - Deploy an Nginx service
  - Add a worker node to the Cluster
  - Upgrade the workload Cluster to the newest version

### OpenNebula's CAPI Appliance

[OpenNebula's Kubernetes (CAPI) appliance](https://marketplace.opennebula.io/appliance/c33522e7-7b7e-4046-bc23-833797431bf0) provides a ready-to-use solution for managing Kubernetes Clusters through the Rancher web UI. The appliance is fully integrated to support OpenNebula as an infrastructure provider via the [Cluster API Provider for OpenNebula](https://github.com/OpenNebula/cluster-api-provider-opennebula).

This tutorial demonstrates how the CAPI appliance eliminates the need for extensive manual configuration -- it allows you to create, manage, and upgrade CAPI-managed RKE2 Clusters in a simple way, reducing operational overhead.

## Step 1. Configure the Networks on the Front-end

For the CAPI appliance to function correctly, we need to modify the configuration of the default public network and add a new private network. Go to **Networks** -> **Virtual networks**.

### Modify the Default Public Network

Select the default public network named `vnet`. Click **Update** at the top of the screen: 

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/sunstone-rancher-update-vnet.png" alt="Sunstone configure networks" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Click **Next** to go to **Advanced options** then in the **Context** tab change the **DNS** field to `8.8.8.8` and then click **Finish**:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/sunstone-rancher-vnet-dns.png" alt="Sunstone configure networks" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

From the **Virtual networks** page, select `vnet` again if it is not already selected and in the **Address** tab click **+ Address Range**. Select **Ethernet / DHCP** and enter `02:00:3c:f0:4d:f9` in the **First MAC address** field, set the size to 16:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/sunstone-rancher-mac-range.png" alt="Sunstone configure networks" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

### Add a Private Network

From the **Virtual networks** page, click the **Create** button at the top. Sunstone will display the **Create Virtual Network** screen. Enter a name for the network -- for this example we will use `private`. Then, click **Next**.

In the next screen, activate the **Use only private host networking or a user-defined bridge** option:

{{< image path="/images/sunstone-create-priv-network.png" alt="Sunstone add networks" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Choose the **Addresses** tab and click **+ Address Range**. Here we will enter a range of private IP addresses. For this example, in **First IPv4 address** enter `192.168.200.2`, and set the network size to `100`.

{{< image path="/images/sunstone-create-priv-network-2.png" alt="Sunstone add address range" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Click **Finish**.

## Step 2. Download the CAPI Appliance

From your OpenNebula Front-end, you can download the CAPI appliance from the Sunstone UI or from the command line.

### Download from the Sunstone UI

Download the CAPI Appliance with the following steps:

1. On the left-hand pane, go to **Storage** -> **Apps**.
1. On the **Apps** screen showing the available apps, filter for `capi`.
1. Click **Service Capi** to select it, then click **Import**.
1. In the import wizard, select the **default** image datastore, then click **Finish**.

### Download from the Command Line

On the Front-end command line, switch to the `oneadmin` user:

```bash
sudo su - oneadmin
```

Then download the CAPI appliance from the marketplace:

```bash
onemarketapp export 'Service Capi' 'Service Capi' --datastore default
```

This automatically downloads the **Service Capi** appliance into the default datastore.

## Step 3. Instantiate the CAPI Appliance

### From the Sunstone UI

To instantiate the Service CAPI appliance, follow the same steps described for [the WordPress VM]({{% relref "validate_the_environment#step-2-instantiate-the-vm" %}}):

1. In the left-hand pane, go to **Templates** -> **VM Templates**.
1. Select **Service Capi**, then click the **Instantiate** <svg width="1.5em" height="1.5em" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="vertical-align: middle;"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="12" fill="rgba(218, 218, 218, 1)" /><path d="M9 7.5v9l7-4.5-7-4.5z" stroke="rgb(143,147,146)" /></svg> icon at the top.

Sunstone displays the **Instantiate VM Template** wizard. Leave the **Configurations** options as default, click **Next** twice to skip the **User inputs** and reach the **Advanced options** step:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/sunstone-rancher-attach-nic.png" alt="Sunstone attach NIC" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Click **Next** to advance to the **Select a network** step:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/sunstone-rancher-nic-vnet.png" alt="Sunstone attach NIC" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Select `vnet`, the default public network. Continue clicking **Next** until the final step and click **Finish**. Click **Finish** again to finish the instantiate VM workflow.

Sunstone will display the **Instances** -> **VMs** screen, showing the newly-created VM:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/sunstone-rancher-capi-vm.png" alt="Sunstone CAPI VM" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Wait a few moments until the VM displays the **RUNNING** state (green dot).

### From the Command Line

To instantiate the CAPI appliance template without additional user inputs, as user `oneadmin` run:

```bash
onetemplate instantiate 'Service Capi' --nic vnet
```

This instantiates the template and attaches the NIC on the public network, **vnet**, to the Virtual Machine.

When you run the command, you will be prompted for user inputs such as the versions for CAPONE, K3s and Turtles. For this tutorial we can leave the values at their defaults, by hitting **Enter** at each prompt.

```default
oneadmin@frontend:~$ onetemplate instantiate 'Service Capi' --nic vnet
There are some parameters that require user input. Use the string <<EDITOR>> to launch an editor (e.g. for multi-line inputs)
  * (ONEAPP_CAPI_CAPONE_VERSION) Capone Version
  * (ONEAPP_CAPI_CERT_MANAGER_VERSION) Cert Manager Chart Version
  * (ONEAPP_CAPI_K3S_VERSION) K3s Version
  * (ONEAPP_CAPI_RANCHER_HOSTNAME) Rancher Hostname
  * (ONEAPP_CAPI_RANCHER_PASSWORD) Rancher Password
  * (ONEAPP_CAPI_RANCHER_VERSION) Rancher Chart Version
  * (ONEAPP_CAPI_TURTLES_VERSION) Turtles Chart Version
VM ID: 
2
```

If you leave the Rancher password empty, it will default to `capi1234` (username `admin`).

The last number in the command output is the ID for the Virtual Machine, in this case `2`.

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
You will need to wait some minutes for the K3s Cluster and the Rancher web UI to become available. The total time will depend on the Front-end machine and the resources assigned to the Cluster -- with the default resource values, the configuration process may take 6 to 8 minutes to complete.
{{< /alert >}}

## Step 4. Connect to the Rancher UI

If you are working on a screen attached to the OpenNebula Front-end server you can connect to the Rancher interface using a web browser and go to `https://<CAPI_VM_IP>.sslip.io`. In this tutorial, the IP is `172.16.100.2`. You can obtain the VM's IP from the Sunstone UI: in the left-hand pane go to **Instances** -> **VMs**, then check IP address displayed for the VM (see image [above](#capi_vm_running)). If you are working on a remote server, please see the [instructions on using port forwarding](#using-ssh-on-remote-hardware).

Alternatively, on the Front-end run:

```bash
onevm show <VM ID>
```

where `VM ID` is the number that was given by the `onetemplate instantiate` command. To quickly filter the IP from the output of `onevm show`, you can run:

```bash
onevm show <VM ID> | grep ETH0_IP=
```

For example:

```default
oneadmin@frontend:~$ onevm show 2 | grep ETH0_IP=
  ETH0_IP="172.16.100.3",
```

In this case we will connect to `https://172.16.100.3.sslip.io`.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_login.png" alt="Rancher login" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

If you did not set a password when instantiating the VM, log in with these credentials:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `capi1234`

{{< alert title="Warning" type="warning" >}}
As mentioned above, with the default resources the complete configuration process for the K3s Cluster and Rancher can take between 6 and 8 minutes to complete. Occasionally, a bug related to the installation of Turtles -- specifically with the `helm-install-rancher-turtles` pod -- may cause the installation to hang. In such cases, if the Rancher interface does not come up you will need to restart the process.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Tip" type="info" >}}
If the Rancher UI takes too long to become available or if you prefer to monitor the process manually, you can log in to the CAPI VM with:

```bash
onevm ssh <VM ID>
```

This will log you in as user `root`. To see the status of the pods during the configuration process, run:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```
{{< /alert >}}

## Step 5. Deploy an OpenNebula RKE2 Cluster

To deploy an OpenNebula RKE2 Cluster we will install it using the RKE2 Helm chart via the Rancher UI.

To install from the Helm chart, follow these steps:

In Rancher's left-hand navigation pane, go to the Management Cluster by clicking the Rancher icon ![rancher](/images/icons/rancher/rancher_icon.png), then select **Apps -> Charts**.

In the **Filter charts results** input field, type `capone`. This should display two charts, `capone-kadm` and `capone-rke2`.

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/rancher-ui-capone-apps.png" alt="Rancher CAPONE apps" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

For this tutorial, select `capone-rke2`.

Rancher will take you to a screen displaying chart details. To install, click the **Install** button at top right.

In the next screen, you can specify the namespace where the resources will be created, as well as an optional name for the Cluster. In this example we will use the `default` namespace, and name `capone4`.

Click **Next**. The next screen shows the YAML configuration file. Here you will need to edit some parameters to adapt the deployment to your environment.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_capone_yaml.png" alt="CAPONE YAML" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
It is not necessary to import the CAPONE appliances -- the only requirement is that the public and private networks in the Cluster definition already exist, as will be shown below.
{{< /alert >}}

Scroll down to the end of the YAML file:

{{< image path="/images/rancher_capone_yaml_bottom.png" alt="CAPONE YAML" align="center" width="60%" mb="20px" >}}

Here you will to ensure that the values of the following parameters match your installation:

- `ONE_AUTH`: User credentials for the Front-end, in `<user>:<password>` format. By default, the user is `oneadmin`. The password is the same as for logging in to Sunstone. If you installed your Front-end using miniONE, the credentials were shown at the end of the installation output. (If you installed using miniONE and are unsure of the credentials, on the Front-end check the contents of `/var/lib/one/.one/one_auth`.)
- `ONE_XMLRPC`: The XML RPC endpoint. This will be the gateway address of the public network that the VM is connected to. In this example, the network is `vnet` and the address is `172.16.100.1`.
- `PRIVATE_NETWORK_NAME`: Name for the private network created on the Front-end, in our case `private`.
- `PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME`: Name for the public network created on the Front-end, in our case `vnet`.

To find the IP for `ONE_XMLRPC` on the Front-end (as oneadmin) run `onevnet show vnet | grep GATEWAY` and use the IP address from the output of this command.

The parameters that were modified for this example are shown below:

```bash
ONE_AUTH: oneadmin:ZMCoOWUsBg
ONE_XMLRPC: http://172.16.100.1:2633/RPC2
PRIVATE_NETWORK_NAME: private
PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME: vnet
```

After modifying the parameters, click the **Install** button on the bottom right corner.

The Cluster should install and deploy; this process can take a few minutes.

In Rancher's left-hand navigation pane, go to the Management Cluster by clicking the Rancher icon ![rancher](/images/icons/rancher/rancher_icon.png), then select **Apps -> Installed Apps**. The list of applications should show the name of the Cluster you deployed (in this example, `capone4`), with status `Deployed`.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_capone_deployed.png" alt="Rancher installed apps" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
You can also verify the deployment on the Front-end, by verifying that three new Virtual Machines have been instantiated:
- On the command line, as user `oneadmin` run `onevm list`:

```default
oneadmin@frontend:~$ onevm list
  ID USER     GROUP    NAME                  ...   STAT  CPU     MEM HOST        ...       TIME
   4 oneadmin oneadmin capone4-ljm6z         ...   runn    1      3G localhost   ...   0d 00h01
   3 oneadmin oneadmin vr-capone4-cp-0       ...   runn    1    512M localhost   ...   0d 00h01
   2 oneadmin oneadmin Capi-2                ...   runn    2      8G localhost   ...   2d 19h37
   0 oneadmin oneadmin Alpine Linux 3.20-0   ...   runn    1    256M localhost   ...   2d 20h03
```

This shows the Virtual Router `vr-capone4-cp-0`, the master node `capone4-ljm6z`, and the CAPI appliance `Capi-2`; as well as an Alpine Linux VM previously installed.

- On the Sunstone UI, you can see the list of instantiated VMs by going to the left-hand pane and selecting **Instances** -> **VMs**.
{{< /alert >}}

## Step 6. Import the Cluster into Rancher

To manage the Cluster in the Rancher UI, you must first import it into Rancher. Go to Cluster Management by clicking the "farmhouse" icon ![icon](/images/icons/rancher/farmhouse.png) near the bottom. Note that you may need to wait several minutes for the new Cluster to appear, refresh the page periodically until it appears.

In the left-hand pane select **Clusters**, and in the **Clusters** screen select the `capone4` Cluster.

Rancher displays the screen for the Cluster, shown below.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_capone_import.png" alt="Rancher CAPONE import" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

This screen shows three alternative commands that you can use for importing the Cluster. In this case, since the Rancher installation uses a self-signed certificate, we will use the second command, with `curl` and `kubectl`:

```bash
curl --insecure -sfL https://172.16.100.3.sslip.io/v3/import/<import file>.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Copy the command from the screen (you can click the command to copy it to the clipboard). Save this command somewhere (e.g. a text file), you will need to edit it and use it later.

Go to the Kubectl Shell for the Management Cluster, go to **Cluster Management** (via the "farmhouse" icon ![icon](/images/icons/rancher/farmhouse.png) at bottom left). Then, in the **Clusters** screen select the `local` Cluster, click the three-dot menu ![icon](/images/icons/rancher/3_dots_menu.png) on the right, and select **Kubectl Shell** from the drop-down.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_open_kubectl_shell.png" alt="Rancher kubectl open shell" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Rancher should display a tab on the bottom of the screen, with the **Kubectl:local** shell:

{{< image path="/images/rancher_kubectl_shell.png" alt="Rancher kubectl shell" align="center" width="60%" mb="20px" >}}

First, before running the import command you must retrieve the kubeconfig file for the workload Cluster. For Cluster `capone4`, run:

```bash
kubectl get secrets capone4-kubeconfig -o jsonpath="{.data.value}" | base64 -d > one-kubeconfig
```

This saves the configuration for the Cluster into the `one-kubeconfig` file.

To import the Cluster you need to edit the `curl` command you previously copied and saved. At the end of the command, after `kubectl apply` add `--kubeconfig one-kubeconfig` before the final `-f -`. For example (the URL has been truncated for brevity):

```default
curl --insecure -sfL https://.../-94vbm.yaml | kubectl apply --kubeconfig one-kubeconfig -f -
```

Executing this command will import the Cluster into Rancher. You should see something similar to the following output in the kubectl console:

```
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/proxy-clusterrole-kubeapiserver created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/proxy-role-binding-kubernetes-master created
namespace/cattle-system created
serviceaccount/cattle created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cattle-admin-binding created
secret/cattle-credentials-dc221df551 created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cattle-admin created
deployment.apps/cattle-cluster-agent created
service/cattle-cluster-agent created
```

Importing the Cluster may take several minutes.

Once the Cluster has been imported, it becomes fully accessible from the Rancher UI, where it is displayed alongside the K3s Cluster.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_2_clusters_listed.png" alt="Rancher cluster list" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

You can now explore and use the Cluster -- for instance installing Helm charts, executing `kubectl` commands, and even upgrading the Kubernetes version of the Cluster. In the next sections we will perform a few example operations.

## Operating the Cluster

This section provides a brief overview of performing day-to-day operations on the workload Cluster through the Rancher UI. Here we will:

- Install Longhorn
- Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) on Longhorn
- Deploy an Nginx instance that uses the Longhorn volume
- Expose the Nginx instance

### Installing Longhorn

In the `capone4` Cluster, select **Cluster Management**, then the `capone4` Cluster:

{{< image path="/images/rancher_goto_wkload_cluster.png" alt="Rancher go to workload cluster" align="center" width="40%" mb="20px" >}}

In the left-hand nav pane for the Cluster, go to **Apps -> Charts**. In the **Filter charts results** input field, type `longhorn`.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_install_longhorn.png" alt="Rancher install Longhorn" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Select the **Longhorn** chart. Rancher should display the details screen for Longhorn:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/rancher-longhorn-chart.png" alt="Rancher Longhorn chart" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Click the **Install** button at top right. Don't adjust any settings and click **Next**, then **Install**.

The Rancher UI will direct you to the **Installed Apps** screen. Longhorn will appear as a new item in the left-hand sidebar:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/rancher-longhorn-sidebar.png" alt="Rancher Longhorn sidebar" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

### Creating a Persistent Volume Claim on Longhorn

In this step we will create the Persistent Volume Claim that will be used by our Nginx deployment.

To create a PVC, in the left-hand nav pane for the Cluster select **Storage** -> **PersistentVolumeClaims**.

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/rancher-create-pvc.png" alt="Rancher Longhorn create PVC" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Rancher will display the **PersistentVolumeClaims** screen. To create a new PVC, click **Create**.

Fill in the required parameters for the PVC:

- In the **Name** field, type `nginx`
- In **Source**, leave at its default option, "Use a Storage Class to provision a new Persistent Volume"
- In the **Storage Class** drop-down, select `longhorn`
- In **Request Storage**, you can modify the default value of 10 GiB to your needs. In this example we will set it to 2 GiB

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/rancher-create-pvc-menu.png" alt="Rancher Longhorn create PVC menu" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Click **Create**.

The PVC should now be listed in the **Storage** -> **PersistentVolumeClaims** tab for the Cluster, shown below.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_pvc_created.png" alt="Rancher Longhorn PVC created" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

### Creating an Nginx Deployment

We will create the Nginx deployment by importing the deployment's YAML definition, to illustrate Rancher's YAML import feature.

Go to the **Cluster Dashboard** (click the icon for the Cluster on the left, then in the Cluster nav pane click **Cluster**). Then, in the top bar click the **Import YAML** icon ![Import YAML](/images/icons/rancher/import_yaml.png):

{{< image path="/images/rancher_import_yaml.png" alt="Rancher import YAML" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Rancher displays the **Import YAML** screen. To deploy Nginx, you can copy and paste the following definition:

```yaml
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: http
        image: nginx:alpine
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/persistent/"
          name: nginx
      volumes:
      - name: nginx
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: nginx
```

Paste the definition into the input box, then click **Import**. Rancher will create a simple Nginx deployment that mounts the PVC we previously created.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_yaml_imported.png" alt="Rancher import YAML" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

To see the Nginx deployment, in the menu for the Cluster select **Workloads** > **Deployments**, and in the `default` namespace look for `nginx`.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_nginx_deployment.png" alt="Rancher NGINX" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Clicking `nginx` displays additional information for the deployment, including its IP, in this case `10.42.0.32`:

{{< image path="/images/rancher_nginx_deployment_2.png" alt="Rancher NGINX" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

### Exposing the Nginx Deployment

For this tutorial, we'll expose the Nginx deployment by creating a **NodePort** service.

To create the service, in Rancher click the **Import YAML** icon ![Import YAML](/images/icons/rancher/import_yaml.png) in the top bar. Then, copy-paste the below definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort
```

This will expose port 80 of the pod running the `nginx` service on port 30080 of the master node in the `capone4` Cluster.

After clicking **Import**, you should see `nginx-service` in the Cluster's **Services** tab:

{{< image path="/images/quickstart/rancher-nginx-service.png" alt="Rancher NGINX" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Now your Nginx deployment should be visible on the external IP of the node -- which in this example setup is `192.168.100.4` -- on port 30080:

{{< image path="/images/rancher_nginx_welcome_screen.png" alt="Rancher NGINX" align="center" width="60%" mb="20px" >}}

## Additional Tasks

### Adding Worker Nodes to the Cluster

{{< alert title="Note" type="info" >}}
Before creating a replica, ensure you have enough resources allocated to the CAPI deployment, and on the machine running the Front-end.
{{< /alert >}}

To add a Worker Node to the Cluster, use CAPI to create a replica of the Cluster.

In Rancher, go to **Cluster Management**, then in the left-hand nav pane **CAPI** -> **Machine Deployments**. Rancher should display the current deployment of the `capone4` Cluster. Clicking the deployment name shows the YAML file for the deployment. To add a replica, click the three-dot menu ![icon](/images/icons/rancher/3_dots_menu.png) at top right, then select **Edit YAML**. Find the string `replicas: 1` and change the number to the desired number of replicas.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_create_replica.png" alt="Rancher create replica" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

### Upgrading the Workload Cluster

To upgrade the Cluster from within Rancher, select **Cluster Management** at bottom left, then **Clusters** on the left-hand pane. Click the three-dot menu ![icon](/images/icons/rancher/3_dots_menu.png) for the Cluster, then select **Edit Config** from the drop-down.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_edit_config.png" alt="Rancher edit config" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Rancher should display the configuration screen for the Cluster. In the **Basics** section, select the desired version for upgrading, then press **Save**. 

{{< image path="/images/rancher_cluster_conf_screen.png" alt="Rancher cluster conf" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Rancher should display the **Clusters** screen, where the Cluster should display status `Upgrading`. The upgrade can take several minutes. To see the upgrade process, click the **Explore** button to the right of the Cluster -- this takes you to the Cluster Dashboard where upgrade messages are displayed.

When the upgrade is finished, the **Clusters** screen should display the Cluster with the new version.

{{< image path="/images/rancher_cluster_upgraded.png" alt="Rancher cluster upgraded" align="center" width="90%" mb="20px" >}}

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a K3s Cluster with the Rancher management platform as well as a production-grade workload Cluster where you've created, exposed and tested a deployment -- all with minimal configuration and using graphical interfaces.

## Next Steps

To learn about OpenNebula in depth, the next sections of the documentation include all of the information necessary for [configuration and administration]({{% relref "product/index" %}}), as well as software [life cycle, releases and installation details]({{% relref "software/index" %}}).

If you are interested in installing OpenNebula by following further tutorials, you can head over to [Automatic Installation with OneDeploy]({{% relref "software/installation_process/advanced_installation_with_onedeploy/one_deploy_overview" %}}) to automatically install a production-ready OpenNebula cloud.

## Using SSH on Remote Hardware

If you are working with OpenNebula deployed on a remote server or an AWS instance, you will need to use port forwarding to access the Rancher UI. From the command line of the OpenNebula Front-end run: 

```bash
sudo su - oneadmin
```

Run `onevm list` to obtain the ID of the CAPI VM, then run `onevm ssh <CAPI_VM_ID>` to access the CAPI VM command line. Then run the following command:

```bash
nohup kubectl -n cattle-system port-forward svc/rancher 8443:443 --address 0.0.0.0 > pf.log 2>&1 &
```

Then from your local machine, run the following port forwarding command, inserting the appropriate IP addresses for the CAPI VM and the remote server (include `-i pem-file.pem` if needed): 

```bash
ssh -L 8443:<CAPI_VM_IP>:8443 user@<REMOTE_IP> # -i pem-file.pem
```

The choosen `user` must have sudo priviledges on the remote server. These commands will set up port forwarding such that the Rancher UI can be accessed through a browser on your local machine by visiting `http://localhost:8443`.
