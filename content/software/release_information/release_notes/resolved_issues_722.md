A complete list of solved issues for 7.2.2 are listed in the [project development portal](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/milestone/93).

## Elastic Kubernetes as a Service
[OneKS]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/overview/" %}}) is a new OpenNebula service that streamlines and simplifies the provisioning and operation of Kubernetes Clusters on OpenNebula cloud deployments. OneKS builds on CAPONE to expose a Cluster-centric lifecycle model for users needing a simple and repeatable way to consume Kubernetes inside OpenNebula.

## Backported Issues

The following new features have been backported to 7.2.2:

<!-- item structure
Include a high level description and a link to the documentation explaining the new feature. Example:

* Add per-VM live migration options through [`MIGRATE_AUTO_CONVERGE` and `MIGRATE_COMPRESSED`]({{% relref "/product/operation_references/configuration_references/template#template-features" %}}) VM template attributes. Administrators can now tune auto-convergence and memory compression only for selected KVM VMs, improving migration reliability and bandwidth usage without changing global driver defaults.

-->

* Support for SRIOV capable network interfaces in [switchdev mode]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/hosts_and_clusters/pci_passthrough.md#usage-as-network-interfaces" %}})
