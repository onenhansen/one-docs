A complete list of solved issues for 7.2.1 are listed in the [project development portal](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/milestone/88). 

## Elastic Kubernetes as a Service
[OneKS]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/overview/" %}}) is a new OpenNebula service that streamlines and simplifies the provisioning and operation of Kubernetes Clusters on OpenNebula cloud deployments. OneKS builds on CAPONE to expose a Cluster-centric lifecycle model for users needing a simple and repeatable way to consume Kubernetes inside OpenNebula.

## Backported Issues

The following new features have been backported to 7.2.1:

* Add option [`LOG_RESULT_LENGTH` to `oned.conf`]({{% relref "/product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/oned#xml-rpc-server-configuration" %}}) to configure max length of API result log.
* Add per-VM live migration options through [`MIGRATE_AUTO_CONVERGE` and `MIGRATE_COMPRESSED`]({{% relref "/product/operation_references/configuration_references/template#template-features" %}}) VM template attributes. Administrators can now tune auto-convergence and memory compression only for selected KVM VMs, improving migration reliability and bandwidth usage without changing global driver defaults.
* Allow the [customization of the favicon in FireEdge]({{% relref "product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/fireedge.md#branding-fireedge" %}}).
* Add optional Prometheus exporter packages for OVS, MySQL/MariaDB, SMART storage health, and LVM monitoring. See [Optional Exporters]({{% relref "/product/cloud_system_administration/prometheus/install#monitor-alert-extra-exporters" %}}) for installation and service details.
* VLAN_ID is not mandatory when creating an Open vSwitch in Sunstone. See [Open vSwitch Networks]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/networking_system/openvswitch/" %}}) for details.
* Improved Open vSwitch VLAN trunking support in the `ovswitch` driver by adding native OVS `trunk` mode when only `VLAN_TAGGED_ID` is defined. Existing configurations using `VLAN_ID` continue to behave as before. Note that untagged traffic is now dropped for pure trunk configurations. See [Multiple VLANs (VLAN trunking)](/product/cluster_configuration/networking_system/openvswitch/#multiple-vlans-vlan-trunking) for details.
* PCI device monitoring now includes [`IFNAME`, `SRIOV` and `SRIOV_NUM` attributes]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/hosts_and_clusters/hosts#host-pci-devices" %}}) to map PCI devices to network interface names and identify SR-IOV Physical/Virtual Functions.
* Move Open vSwitch DPDK socket directory to `/var/run/one/vhost-socks` [#7673](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/7673).
* Add [Elastic Kubernetes as a Service with OneKS]({{% relref "platform_services/oneks/getting_started/overview/" %}}).
