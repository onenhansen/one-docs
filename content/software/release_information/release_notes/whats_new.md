## Storage & Backups
- New redesigned version of [LVM Storage Subsystem (EE)]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/lvm/lvm.md" %}}) with native thin-provisioning, unified image and VM disk management, and simplified configuration. The new driver improves performance, reduces deployment complexity, and enables more efficient use of SAN-backed storage by eliminating the need for hybrid file-based setups.
- [Storage Live Migration for LVM & file-based datastores]({{% relref "product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/vm_instances/#virtual-machine-datastore-migration" %}}) with ability to perform live migrations of Virtual Machines across LVM and file-based datastores (both shared, local and lvm thin).
- [NetApp Incremental Backup Support]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/san_storage/netapp/" %}}) with improved efficiency for NetApp users with new incremental backup capabilities that reduce backup windows and storage consumption by only saving changed data blocks.
- [Support for Everpure FlashArray]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/san_storage/everpure/" %}}) with a native storage driver for managing the full block storage lifecycle directly through the FlashArray REST API.
- [VirtioFS]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/storage_system/virtiofs_ds.md" %}}) datastores enable Virtual Machines to directly access Host filesystems, providing fast, low-latency shared file access. This simplifies data sharing across VMs while improving performance for data-intensive workloads.

## Sunstone
- Integrated VM Logs in Sunstone provide real-time VM execution logs directly through the Sunstone GUI, enabling faster troubleshooting without CLI access.
- Backups, images and files tabs added by default in the groupadmin view and a Services Tab has been added by default in the user view.
- [Enforced Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in Sunstone]({{% relref "/product/cloud_system_administration/authentication_configuration/sunstone_auth/#enforce-globally" %}}) strengthens your cloud security posture by mandating 2FA for all users within the Sunstone GUI through a global security policy.

## API and CLI
- [New API calls]({{% relref "/product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/vm_instances.md#execute-commands-inside-the-virtual-machine" %}}) (`one.vm.exec`, `one.vm.retryexec` and `one.vm.cancelexec`) to execute commands on a Virtual Machine.
- [Add automatic VM index for multiple persistent VM instantiation]({{% relref "/product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/vm_instances.md#instantiate-to-persistent" %}}).

## KVM & Networking
- [Virtual Machine memory encryption]({{% relref "/product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/vm_templates#memory-encryption" %}}) allows VM workloads whose memory cannot be read by the hypervisor.
- [Shared Address Ranges]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/networking_system/manage_vnets.md#shared-address-ranges-shared-ar-for-virtual-ips" %}}) with [NIC Alias support]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/networking_system/manage_vnets.md#using-virtual-ips" %}}) to enable the assignment of Virtual IPs that can be shared across multiple VMs.
- DPDK `dpdkvhostuserclient` NICs can now be [Hot-plugged]({{% relref "/product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/vm_instances.md#nic-hot-plugging" %}}).
- `vhost` unix sockets are now created in a dedicated directory - `/var/lib/one/vhost-sockets`.

## LXC
- NIC Hot-plugging, recontextualization and NIC PCI passthrough are now available  as [driver features]({{% relref "/product/operation_references/hypervisor_configuration/lxc_driver.md" %}}).
- [LXC Disk Snapshots]({{% relref "/product/operation_references/hypervisor_configuration/lxc_driver.md" %}}) are now available for the following storage backends: LVM, LVM thin, Ceph RBD, and raw file images.

## OpenNebula Form
- [OneForm Automated Cluster Provisioning]({{% relref "product/cluster_provisioning/overview/" %}}) is a new service designed to automate the creation of OpenNebula Clusters across on-premises environments and cloud providers, simplifying hybrid cloud strategies through unified, on-demand deployment.
